\subsection{Embedding Fragments statically/dynamically in Activity}
Trying to use the provided templates for google material designed activities and
fragments, I run into the situation where fragments where by default embedded into
activities by instantiating them in XML. This works fine when the Activity/Fragment
combo in question does not need to obtain extras on creation. In many cases however,
for example when the Activity/Fragment combo represents the detail view after a
list activity, the ID of the chosen list item has to be obtained. Hence, the given
template code had to be modified for dynamic instantiation of the fragment from
within the activity.
During planning for the above modification, it was noted that there are at least
three single activity / single fragment views in the current application. According
to the example in the course book, this could make up for an `Abstract'
`SingleFragmentActivity' class. However, it was decided against this due to
implications on the material design elements: The Appbar and Floating Action Button
are kept in the activity, while the content layout is in the fragment. But the
three single fragment activities don't share exactly the same setup for appbar
and Floating Action Buttons. Hence another layer of abstraction would be needed that
would make things overly verbose.

\subsection{Deciding on the Persistance Model} It was from the beginning decided
to store the data in SQLite. It was needed to decide how to store data from the
UI on for example orientation changes. Currently, in the IngredientChooser, when
an ingredient is not selected, the value will not persist when the device
changes orientation. To come to a somehow fluent user experience, it was decided
to connect the checkbox for selected with the textchange listener of the entry
boxes. Hence, when text is entered, the selected textbox is activated. In the
same sense, to improve the user experience, unselecting the checkbox will
automatically also empty the entry fields. As such, it is no longer possible to
have entered text without selection active. Hence, on orientation change, all
data will be stored in the DB and read back on resume.

\subsection{Deciding on Ingredient Chooser UI}
Showing zero's or not. Showing a search bar. Sorting alphabetically.

\subsection{In InigredientChooser, correct initial focus}
On ActivityStartup, always the first field get's focus before data is loaded.
The onFocus method then determines that there is no data, hence it writes/overwrites
directly a zero to the database. The solution was to add a dummy focus on the
title element in the XML file.
